## Lyrics

```
I've been feeling every sec, eyes on face
tricked and ticking quicker only when I count my days
I've seen ground when I knelt, so much bound and inert
only thing I want to know I'm not a gimmick to myself

I'll never set your scale, I'll always be aware
I overstayed my tale, withstood all I care
I'll never set your scale, I'll always be aware
I overstayed my tale, I overstayed my tale

Never soon to reac
